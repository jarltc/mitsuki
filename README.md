I wrote this little program to organize my camera photos automatically from an SD card.
This program separates images into folders for each year, then into specific dates (UTC). Each date contains separate folders for RAW and JPG files.

Ex.: folder > 2025 > 250630 > RAW/JPG 

I recommended to clear the SD card after each transfer so the algorithm doesn't get needlessly heavy; it could still use some optimization at the moment.
